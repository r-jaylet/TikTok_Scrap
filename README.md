# TikTok_Scrap

Develop procedures in Python based on the existing TikTok data extraction APIs. The idea is to extract metadata from a list of videos (comments, captions, number of likes, number of subscribers of the author) and to use this data to make queries by recursively following links such as "is a subscriber to...", "duets with..."
